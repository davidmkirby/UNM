***
HW7_Data.mat contains data.
SapkotaHW7_hist.m function switching the cases for the nargin or nargout
***
Sapkota_HW7.m contains-

1) problem-1 use SapkotaHW7_hist.m to give identical output on nargin and nargout

2) problem-2 produces numbers that are nearly normally distributed. then Generate 1000
   numbers and show the histogram.  Use the central limit theorem to explain
   how this works.

3) problem-3 use file 'HW7_Data.mat' contains two variables, 'Y' and 'T'. then Use
 Newton's method to do a least-squares fit of the data to the model Y(T)=A*T
 Plot our fit result on top of the data with circles.

4) problem-4 generate a 2D random walk in square region.
