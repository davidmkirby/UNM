�-In this project we simulate the behaviour of birds in a two dimenisonal space
�-Our goal is to use a ordinary differential equation to stimulate the behavour of the flock of 
birds along with the leader bird.
�The leader bird runs towards the crazy bird feeder and all the other birds follow the leader bird
�-This source code is located in the code directory
�The simulation movie of behaviour of birds with varaying parameters and smelly bird is located 
in the MOVIE directory

Compile, Run, Graph and movie

make         # compile
make run      # run the program 
make graph    #  graph the frame of the birds at a time ( need a matlab installed and running)
make movie    #  joint all the frames to make videos ( need FFmpeg)

The directory CODE contains the following files and sub directory with withoutsmiley containing same file where there is no smiley bird:-
1) RK4_leader.f90
2) feederbird.f90
3) flockingbird.f90
4) frames.f90
5) repelforce.f90 
6) values.f90
7) plotsmiley.m


The directory MOVIE containts following items
1) Movie with different parameter Movie_1 to Movie_6 without smiley and Movie_7 and Movie_8 with smiley and changing mu. see the README file for detail of parameter and representation of differnt things like feeder, smiley, leader and birds in README 


REPORT sub directory contains-
 
1)HW5.pdf
2)HW5.tex

This project was pushed using a ubuntu system form local machine.
