·-This project is on computing  integral and derivatives on a logically rectangular domain by using 
  a smooth mapping from a reference element and error on their computation.
·-We can see in this project that 2d curvelinear system can be mapped using a reference element also
.-The error plot obtained from the error in differentiation has also been included.
·-This source code form the professor and our code is included in the code directory.
 
- compile,run and graph code

  make # for compile 
  make run # for running code 
  make plot # for graphing 
  make clean # cleaning all o flag and unnecessary files 

The sub directory Source contains the code form professor-
1) differentiate.f90
2) homework4.f90
3) plotgrid.m(matlab code for plotting the grid)
4) printdble.f90
5) xycoord.f90 
6) errors.f90

This project contains following code to compute the derivative/integral and for smooth mapping-
1) metric.f90
2) trapazoidal2d.f90
3) hw4laplace.f90
4) plotgriderror.m
5) testcase.f90
6) printerror.m

The subdirectory laplace inside code consist:-
1) metric.f90
2) trapazoidal2d.f90
3) hw4laplace.f90
4) plotgriderror.m
5) testcase.f90
6) printerror.m
REPORT sub directory contains-
 
1)Report.pdf
2)main.txt
3)figures which is attached on report

This project was pushed using a ubuntu system.The text editor nano was used to create this readme file and
 -Git codes like add, push and commit were used it to push it to the online repository from my local machine
