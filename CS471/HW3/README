· -This project is about approximating the given integral and calculate error in approximation using trapezoidal and gauss quadrature by      writing a Fortran script
· -This is a Homework report in directory HW3 contain two sub-directory 

CODE sub directory contains-
1) functions.f90
2) Trapezoidal.f90(for the trapezoid rule)
3) gauss_quadrature.f90(for quadrature rule)
4) lglnodes.f90
5) HW3.f90 
6) errors.f90
7) matlaberror.m
8) data.txt

REPORT sub directory contains-
Anyone can navigate Report.pdf to compile the code and reproduce results. 
1) Report.pdf
2) errorplot.jpg
3) Report.txt

which has been added committed and then pushed.
· -It includes function. f90 which contains the functions we are working with, trapezoid.f90 contains the subroutine for trapezoid rule and gauss_quadrature.f90 contains the quadrature rule
· -The text editor vim was used to create this readme file -Git codes like add, push and commit were used it to push it back to the online repository from my local machine
