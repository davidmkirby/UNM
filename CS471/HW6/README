This project is about using openMP to calculate derivative and integral(extended version of Homework-4).
The code is run on stampede2 super computer and all the plot is done on matlab. 

Running code on stampede2

1) make # set -openfmp
2) sbatch ompbatch_1.job  #check the ompbatch_1.job depending on number on cores one need and time 
3) make clean   #clean all -o flag, .mod file

Running code on PC(check the number of core you pc have and set to required core and then procedure)

1) make  #set gfortran on make file
2) ./homework6.x # to see the output 

There are two directory in this homework. 

CODE directory consists:- 
1)differentiate.f90
2)printdble.f90
3)homework4.f90
4)homeowork6.f90
5)trapezoidal2d.f90
6)xycoord.f90
7) ompbatch_1.job
8) speedandefficiency.m, weakgrid.m and strong2000qs.m
9) some .txt outfile from stampede and .jpeg plot file 


REPORT directory consists:-
1)HW6.pdf
2)main.txt
3).jpeg file used in reports
