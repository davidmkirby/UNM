author- Susan Sapkota & Anish Adhikari

All the respective homeworkâ€™s are located in the specific folder along with the codes and the reports the master directory is 471SAPKOTA and inside it will be sub-directories with folders respective to HomeWorks and all required materials.

1)-HW1-

o Is located in the HW1 directory it is just a simple exercise to add/commit/push a text file from the local machine to the online repository for gaining some experience.

2)-HW2-

o Is located in the directory HW2 in the repository.

o This repository contains script code for modified newton method convergence in HW2/code.

o It also contains report field from latex on homework 2 in HW2_report.pdf which will tell us how we can compile HW2

3)-HW3-

o The report is in the directory inside HW3/doc in the REPORT sub-direcroty named Report.pdf. This sub- directory also includes the source code to the Report.txt and the errorplot.jpg that contains the error figure.This report.pdf will tell us about the how to run HW3 and a short description about the project and about the results were obtain and the error and error plot.

o The source code for the project is located in HW3/CODE; it contains the function.f90, trapezoid.f90(for the trapezoid rule) , gauss_quadrature.f90(for quadrature rule), lglnodes.f90 and errors.f90 and integral.It also includes two make file error -and integral are included and all the executable files are also included.

4)-HW4-

o In this homework we compute the integral and derivative on a rectangular domain using a smooth mapping and a reference element.

o The error in diffrentiation has been plotted and included in the repository.

o The directory REPORT is includes report.pdf source code for the latex file "main.tex" and figures used in the project

o The source folder contains the code from the professor

o Anyone can navigate through the README in HW4 directory to get a brief description about the project and compiling, running and graphing

o CODE subdirectory consist code for integration and inside CODE there is subdirectory laplace for laplace calculation 


5)-HW5-

o All required files and documents are located in the HW5 directory

o In this homework we model a flocking behaviour of birds using odinary differential equation.

o We implement RK4 and experiment with different number of birds and different values of parameter.

o The directory REPORT  includes HW5.pdf source code for the latex file "HW5.tex".

o The directory MOVIE contains different movies without smiley and with smiley with different birds numbers and parameters. 

o Anyone can navigate through the README in HW4 directory to get a brief discripition about the project

o for information on compiling, running, graphing and making movie, see the README file 


6)-HW6-


o In this homework, we used openMP to compute differentiation, integral and error in their calculation(extended version of HW4)

o All the required files and document are inside HW6 directory 

o One can navigate through README in HW6 directory to locate the project,compiling,running and graphing

o CODE subdirectory consists of code for used in HW6

o REPORT subdirectory has HW6.pdf and its latex source file "main.txt" with figures used in the report.
